## Aptos Count Dapp

a gameFI that allows user to mint a unique NFT based on certain mathematical properties


### Concept

User need to perform an action to reach a value derive from certain mathematical sequences



An actions consists of 3 types
- increment (increase the value by 1)
- decrement (decrease the value by 1)
- random (either increment or decrement)

When the value is achieved a single unique NFT will be minted for that collection

The max number of mintable NFT in a collection is determined by the mathematical sequence

This creates an intrinsic value for each minted NFT through collaboration of many users to achieve that count together.

The minted NFT will have an unique artwork that is generated from the mathematical properties

An example of a mathematical sequence is fibonacci sequence. The maximum number of NFT available for this collection is only 185 NFT (limit by 128bit unsigned integer counter value)

There are various different types of mathematical sequences that can be used for this

Every action made by user, a new COUNT coin is minted and transfer to user. This coin can be used for various purposes in the dapp

### COUNT coin utilities

- As a entry fee to perform an action
- Allow using this coin for changing the dapp theme
- Allow using this coin for NFT trading
- To create new mathematical sequences collection
- Etc


### Count input method

There are various method that we can use for the input to change the count value

- User manually click to perform action in dapp
- User smartphone data like shaking, steps and etc are used to map to the ation
- Etc
